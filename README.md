## Overview

This project develops a conversational chatbot, initially based on the **LLaMA model**. Due to deployment constraints on Azure, we transitioned to an alternative solution using the **Google Generative AI API**, showcased in a **Streamlit** application. The chatbot integrates **MLflow** to track interactions, enabling evaluation and analysis of AI responses and overall performance.

### Chatbot Modes

The chatbot application operates in two distinct modes, each with a unique system prompt to guide the model's role:

1. **Learning Mode**: The chatbot acts as an **expert English teacher**, providing explanations, corrections, and guidance on grammar and vocabulary.

2. **Practice Mode**: The chatbot functions as a **conversational partner**, helping users improve their English through casual conversation practice, encouraging natural language use.

Each mode uses a structured prompt template to maintain clarity and consistency in responses, as shown in the images below:

## Methodology

### Datasets & preprocessing

- **Grammar Correction Dataset**  
  - Cleaned data, handled missing values, applied filtering, and performed sentiment scoring with the VADER lexicon.

- **English Dictionary Dataset**  
  - Performed some analysis including frequency distribution analysis to enhance understanding of word usage patterns.

### Model Selection
- Adapted the **LLaMA** model to meet chatbot-specific requirements.
- Fine-tuned the **NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf** model using quantization techniques on Google Colab. Utilized quantization to reduce the model's memory footprint.

### Deployment Using Streamlit Framework
- Deployed the chatbot using **Streamlit**, providing a user-friendly interface with multi-mode interaction. The integration with **MLflow** allows tracking and managing interactions, helping refine the user experience.


### How to Run the App Locally
To run the chatbot application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaraSaadoun/Engli-tutor-bot.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the app directory:
  ```bash
  cd app
  ```
3. Create a .env file:
- Inside the app directory, create a .env file and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY:
```makefile
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```
4. Install required dependencies:
- Run the following command to install all necessary Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the app with Streamlit:
- Start the application by running:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
- After running these commands, the application should be accessible locally in your browser at http://localhost:8501.
